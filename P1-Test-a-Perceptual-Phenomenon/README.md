- INTRO TO RESEARCH METHODS: Identify several statistical study methods and describe the positives and negatives of each
- VISUALIZING DATA: Create and interpret histograms, bar charts, and frequency plots
- CENTRAL TENDENCY: Compute and interpret the 3 measures of center for distributions: the mean, median, and mode
- VARIABILITY: Quantify the spread of data using the range and standard deviation; Identify outliers in data sets using the interquartile range
- STANDARDIZING: Convert distributions into the standard normal distribution using the Z-score; Compute proportions using standardized distributions
- NORMAL DISTRIBUTION: Use normal distributions to compute probabilities; Use the Z-table to look up the proportions of observations above, below, or in between values
- SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS: Apply the concepts of probability and normalization to sample data sets
- ESTIMATION: Estimate population parameters from sample statistics using confidence intervals
- HYPOTHESIS TESTING: Use critical values to make decisions on whether or not a treatment has changed the value of a population parameter
- T-TESTS:Test the effect of a treatment or compare the difference in means for two groups when we have small sample sizes
